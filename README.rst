HTML Node - Simple HTML Generator
=====================================

`HTML Node` is a Domain Specific Language (DSL) using Python to generate HTML templates. By using DSL instead of a specific templating language, you can write native Python code to render HTML for your application. You can debug your presentation logics easier than going through the string processing of a specific templating language. Also, you get the full power of Python in writing presentation logic, without the need to learn another templating language.

Feature: 
- Very simple syntax and natural element name
- Unicode support
- Template inheritance support
- Auto-completion support for most IDEs for valid HTML elements
